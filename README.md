# Emotion Recognition From Speech Model

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to recognize human emotions from speech. The project utilizes various deep learning techniques to analyze audio data and classify emotions.

# Features
- **Audio Processing**: Convert raw audio files into spectrograms.
- **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model on processed audio to detect emotions.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Implement real-time emotion recognition using the trained model.

# Installation

Follow the below steps to set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RishiRaj292/Emotion-Recognition-From-Speech-Model.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-From-Speech-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
